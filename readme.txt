Fraud Gmail / Clone Gmail / Doteted Gmail Filter For Registration.

== Description ==

Gmail doesn’t recognize dots as characters within usernames (email). So when one register with a email like `saiful@gmail.com` He can register in your wordpress site using same email just by using some of Gmail’s Trick.

*	Append a plus `(“+”)` sign and any combination of words or numbers after your email address. For example, if your name was `saiful@gmail.com`, you could send mail to `saiful+islam@gmail.com` or `saiful+lol@gmail.com`.
*	Insert one or several dots `(“.”)` anywhere in your email address. Gmail doesn’t recognize periods as characters in addresses — we just ignore them. For example, you could tell people your address was `saiful@gmail.com`, `saiful.islam@gmail.com` or `s.a.i.f.u.l@gmail.com`. (We understand that there has beensome confusion about this in the past, but to settle it once and for all, you can indeed receive mail at all the variations with dots.)

I decided to solve this issue , so i wrote a plugin which prevent bad guys from using same mail for registration.  I wish you guys enjoy this plugin.
